                                        </a>  as they can be very sensitive to chemicals in the water. This one proves the right PH level, maintaining pH 5.5-6.5 </p>
                                        <p><b>Sensitivity to Changes: </b> Acclimating them gradually to new conditions and avoiding sudden changes in light, temperature, or humidity is essential for this family.</p>
                                        <p><h3>Care</h3>
                                        <p><b>Temperature and Humidity:</b> Alocasias prefer warm temperatures and high humidity tip; make a greenhouse and place it next to the radiator.  Here are some ideas <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/diy-indoor-greenhouse-5524846">Indoor Greenhouse Ideas
                                        </a>, using a humidifier can ge also be beneficial. </p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>Fertilisation and Soil:</b>  Use a well-draining potting mix with liquid fertiliser every 2-4 weeks. Over-fertilizing or using the wrong soil type can negatively impact the plant.
                                        Reduce fertilisation in fall and winter when the plant is semi-dormant.</p>
                                        <p><b>Labscission - dormancy period:</b>  It is a natural cycle for them to lose leaves which accrues in winder where it become yellow and firs and it dies so they can grow next to more giant leaves
                                        Disease and Pests: They have high potential, meet the right requirements, and will develop certain pests like spider mites.</p>
                                         
                                        <p><b>Light:</b>
                                        Alocasias generally prefer bright, indirect light. It's best to avoid exposing them to too much direct sunlight, as that can cause their leaves to scorch.
                                        Protect them from harsh afternoon sun, especially in hotter days. </p>
                                        <p><b>Watering:</b>
                                         can be sensitive to overwatering, so it's best to keep the soil moist but not damp and allow the top inch of the soil to dry.  tip: Investing in moisture meture can be helpful.</p>
                                         <p><b> Humidity:</b>
                                        Alocasias thrive in high humidity. Placing plants together will make a more humid microclimate.</p>
                                        <p><b>Temperature:</b>
                                        Alocasias prefer warm temperatures between (18-27°C). Keep them away from drafts and sudden drops in temperature.</p>
                                        <p><b>Soil:</b>
                                        Use a well-draining potting mix. Tips: Try orchid mix or aroid plants, which are often suitable. </p>
                                        <p><b>Pruning and propagation:</b>
                                        Remove yellow or damaged leaves regularly.
                                        Alocasias can be propagated by division during the growing season.
                                        They also contain coils in the soil that can grow new leaves out of it tips; close them in a seethrough  box with a lid and place it next to radiater, open sometimes to create ventilations</p>
                                        <p><b>Potting and Repotting:</b>
                                        Repot when the plant shows roots bound or the soil becomes depleted. Spring session is generally a good time for repotting.</p>
                                        <p><h3>Considerations before Purchasing</h3>
                                            <b>Space:</b>
                                        Ensure you have a larger space than expected, as their growth can be speedy. </p>
                                        <p><b>Toxicity:</b>
                                        Alocasias contain calcium oxalate crystals which can be toxic if ingested. Keep them out of reach of pets and children.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><h3>Tips for Success</h3>

                                        Philodendrons purify indoor air by filtering out common pollutants, improving air quality.</p>
                                        <p><b>Adaptability:</b>
                                        Suitable for both beginners and experienced plant enthusiasts. Their forgiving nature makes Philodendrons easy to care for, and they can adapt even if you miss a watering or two.</p>
                                        <p><b> Attractive Foliage:</b>
                                        The foliage of Philodendrons can range from glossy green to variegated patterns, adding visual interest to indoor spaces.</p>
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        <h3>Issues</h3>
                                        Philodendrons are generally considered easy to care for, making them suitable for beginners.
                                        They forgive occasional lapses in care, such as missed waterings or lower light conditions.</p>
                                        
                                        
                                        <h3>Care</h3>
                                        <p><b>Light:</b>
                                        Philodendrons like bright, indirect light, but some can survive in lower light. Avoid direct sunlight to prevent leaf burn.</p>
                                        <p><b>Watering:</b>
                                        Philodendrons prefer slightly moist but not waterlogged soil.</p>
                                        <p><b>Humidity:</b>
                                        While they can adapt to average humidity levels, Philodendrons appreciate higher humidity. Misting or placing them in a more humid environment can be beneficial.</p>
                                        <p><b>Temperature:</b>
                                        Philodendrons do well in typical indoor temperatures ranging from (18-27°C).
                                        Avoid any sudden temperature changes and drafts.</p>
                                        <p><b>Soil:</b>
                                         A well-draining potting mix is preferred, like a mix of aroids or tropical plants.</p>
                                         <p><b>Fertilisation:</b>
                                        Apply a liquid fertiliser every 2-4 weeks in spring and summer. In fall and winter, reduce the amount of fertilisation as they grow slower.</p>
                                        <p><b>Pruning propagation:</b>
                                        Trim yellow or damaged leaves regularly.
                                        Philodendrons can be propagated easily through stem cuttings.</p>
                                        <p><h3>Considerations before purchasing</h3>
                                            <p><b>Space:</b>
                                        Philodendrons can vary in size, so consider the available space in your home. Some species are compact, while others can become quite large.</p>
                                        <p><b>Toxicity:</b>
                                        Many Philodendron species contain calcium oxalate crystals and can be toxic if ingested. Keep them out of reach of pets and children.</p>
                                        <p><b> Growth Habit:</b>
                                        Some Philodendrons are climbers and may benefit from support structures or hanging baskets. In contrast, others have a more upright growth habit. Choose one that suits your space.</p>
                                        <p><h3>Tips for Success</h3>
                                            <p><b>Observation: </b>Pay attention to your Philodendron's response to its environment. Adjust care based on its specific needs.</p>
                                        <p><b>Varied Species:</b> While most Philodendrons share similar care requirements, specific species may have unique preferences. Research the particular variety you own.</p>

                                        <p><b>Light: </b>
                                        Monstera plants prefer bright, indirect light. Can adapt to low light, but it increases the risk of not giving them the growth potential. </p>

                                         <p><b>Light:</b>
                                        Despite their preference for bright, indirect light, pothos plants can tolerate lower levels of light. Direct sunlight can scorch their leaves, so they can also adapt to fluorescent lighting.
                                        Lack of light can cause leaves to be further apart. </p>
                                        <p><b>Watering:</b>
                                        Dry out the soil on top before watering. Despite its preference for slightly moist soil, Pothos can tolerate occasional drying. Overwatering causes root rot, so drainage is vital.</p>
                                        <p><b>Humidity:</b>
                                        Pothos is adaptable to average humidity levels but benefits from occasional misting, especially in drier indoor environments.</p>
                                        <p><b>Temperature:</b>
                                        Ideal temperatures for them are between (18-27°C); manage cooler temperatures, but drafts and cold air drafts can cause other problems.</p>
                                        <p><b>Soil:</b>
                                        Use a well-draining, all-purpose potting mix.</p>
                                        <p><b>Fertilization:</b>
                                        During the growing season (spring and summer), apply liquid fertilizer at deleted half strength every 4-6 weeks. In the fall/ winter, fertilization should be reduced.</p>
                                        <p><b>Pruning:></b>
                                        For bushier growth, trim leggy stems, known for their trailing vines, to make them a fuller and desirable shape.</p>
                                        
                                        <h3>Considerations before Purchasing</h3>
                                        <p><b>Space & pruning:</b>
                                        Pothos is a trailing or climbing plant.
                                        use placement on shelves/ Support totem pole coir like moss stick 
                                         Known for its fast growth. Regular pruning may be essential to control its size.</p>
                                         <p><b>Toxicity:</b>
                                         Toxic if consumed, so it's essential to keep it out of reach of pets and children</p>
                                        
                                         <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
                                         <p><b>Regular Inspection:</b>
                                         Observe the soil moisture and adjust watering accordingly, as they prefer to dry out between the waterings.</p>
                                         <p><b>Pruning and Training:</b>
                                        Regular pruning controls the size and shape of the plant, with the potential to train Pothos to climb or trail in the direction of preference.</p>
